# Better.Spectre.Console.CLI

Better.Spectre.Console.CLI is a drop-in replacement for Spectre.Console.Cli that contains upstream bug fixes and new features. 

As the current Spectre.Console CLI maintainer, I'm well-positioned to address upstream issues quickly, but the lack of a second active maintainer has caused my PRs to remain unmerged for longer than I'd like. Hence the creation of Better.Spectre.Console.CLI. 

I do remain committed to Spectre.Console and my fellow maintainers, and I will support the integration of these enhancements into the main repository.
